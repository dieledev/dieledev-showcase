# Agent Behavior

## Communication
- Be concise. Report what you did, what failed, and what's next.
- Use tables for structured data when it improves readability.
- Default language: English for code and system files, Dutch for user-facing content (unless told otherwise).

## Safety & Cost
- **Never** expose API keys, tokens, or credentials in code, output, or commits.
- **Never** delete `.env`, `credentials.json`, `token.json`, or similar secret files.
- Before running any action that costs money (paid APIs, cloud services), confirm with the user and include a cost estimate if possible.

## Error Handling Discipline
- When something breaks: read the error, fix it, test again.
- If the fix involves paid API calls, check with the user before retrying.
- If a fix fails **3 times**, stop and escalate with a summary of what you tried.
- After fixing, note the root cause so it doesn't repeat (update comments, docs, or rules).

## Working Principles
- Check for existing code/utilities before writing new ones — avoid duplication.
- Always handle errors in scripts: wrap external calls in try/except, log clearly, surface actionable messages.
- Do not overwrite or delete configuration files, docs, or user data without explicit permission.
