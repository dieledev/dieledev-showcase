# Python Standards

## Language & Style
- Python 3.11+ — use type hints, f-strings, and `pathlib` for file paths.
- Create directories with `Path.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)`.

## Dependencies
- Track in `requirements.txt` with minimum version pins (e.g., `requests>=2.31.0`).
- Use `python-dotenv` to load environment variables from `.env`.

## Error Handling
- Always wrap API/external calls in `try/except` with specific exception types.
- Log the error with enough context to debug, then raise or return a clear message.
- Never use bare `except:` — at minimum catch `Exception`.

```python
# Good
try:
    response = requests.get(url, timeout=10)
    response.raise_for_status()
except requests.RequestException as e:
    logger.error(f"Failed to fetch {url}: {e}")
    raise
```

## Logging
- Use `print()` for simple scripts; use the `logging` module for anything with multiple stages or error recovery.

## Project Hygiene
- Shared helper functions go in a `utils.py` module (or a `utils/` package for larger projects).
- Intermediate/temp files go in `.tmp/` — never commit this directory.
- Secrets (`.env`, credential files) must be in `.gitignore`.
